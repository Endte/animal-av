ID3 has created a decision tree which explains the data. 

Two remarks:
- If such a learning algorithm is used in practice, there should be much more example observations. 
This small number of examples is definitely not sufficient to build a general concept.
ID3 classifies new examples based on the training data. This data should therefore be representative.
	
- ID3 is not perfect. Some generated trees can't explain ANY new observation: It may happen that during classification 
there is no corresponding edge for a NEW value of an example's feature, because ID3 did not know this value during 
tree construction. ID3 will also not terminate in case of inconsistencies in the data: At least two data points 
differ ONLY in the class value.
