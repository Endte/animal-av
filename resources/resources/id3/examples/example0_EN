Example: An owner of a small bar is interested in the circumstances in which people play billiards in his bar. Therefore,
he asks his guests questions about some aspects and stores the results in a table (called the 'main table'). One example 
contains information about whether the person felt motivated (MOTIVATION), whether or not they were tired (TIRED) and how 
much money they brought with them (MONEY). And finally, the class value (on the right, 'yes' or 'no') describes whether 
the person played billiards or not. ID3 takes these examples as an input to come up with a general concept about what 
causes people to (not) play billiards.

When a new person enters the bar (with a certain motivation and a certain amount of money in their pockets, tired 
or not tired) the bar owner (and you!) can try to forecast whether they will play billiards: 
Starting at the root node, follow the edges that correspond to the attribute values of the person; the 
leaf that you'll reach tells the expectation (but, of course, only based on the previously seen examples).
