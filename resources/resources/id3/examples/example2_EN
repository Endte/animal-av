Example: A band wants to make a new album with a great title song on it. But currently, none of the band members has a clue
how this title song should be. The guitar player has an idea: He gathers some information about the previous title songs and whether
they became world hits or not (in the 'main table'). One entry contains information about the music style (STYLE), the text creativity
(CREATIVITY) and whether a violin had a key part in it (VIOLIN). And finally, the class value (on the right, 'yes' or 'no') 
describes whether the song became a hit or not. 
ID3 takes these examples as an input to come up with a general concept about which songs become hits.

Now, the band can come up with ideas about how to design their new song. The tree provides predictions 
telling whether a song will become a world hit. And this is how to determine a prediction:
Starting at the root node, follow the edges that correspond to the attribute values of the song; the 
leaf that you'll reach tells the expectation (but, of course, only based on the previously seen examples).
