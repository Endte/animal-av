Example: 
You created your own example! 

Now, ID3 will create a decision tree to predict the class 'ยง' with
the attributes 'ยง', 'ยง' and 'ยง'. 
Let's see how this tree will be generated!

It was created from your specified input data! 
How to get a prediction for a new example:
Starting at the root node, follow the edges that correspond to the attribute values of an example; the 
leaf that you'll reach tells the expectation (but, of course, only based on the previously seen examples).
