#Die Einfuehrung
INTRO0=Trial Division is the most laborious but easiest to understand
INTRO1=of the integer factorization algorithms.
INTRO2=The essential idea behind trial division tests to see if an
INTRO3=integer n, the integer to be factored, can be divided by each
INTRO4=number in turn that is less than n.
INTRO5=
INTRO6=The following slide will show the factorization of

#Die Erklaerungen
EXPLANATIONS0=
EXPLANATIONS1=Explanation: Prepare an empty list
EXPLANATIONS2=Explanation: The first possible factor
EXPLANATIONS3=Explanation: While n still has remaining factors...
EXPLANATIONS4=Explanation: If n can be divided by the factor
EXPLANATIONS5=Explanation: Add factor to the list
EXPLANATIONS6=Explanation: Divide that factor out of n
EXPLANATIONS7=Explanation: If f is not a factor of n
EXPLANATIONS8=Explanation: Increase the factor by 1
EXPLANATIONS9=Explanation: Return list of prime factors

#Die Zusammenfassung
OUTRO0=The Trial Division algorithm as shown before computes the factorization of the given number.
OUTRO1=in this case the given number was:
OUTRO2=
OUTRO3=and the computed factors were:
OUTRO4=
OUTRO5=Factorization means that multiplying the produced values will result in the given number.
OUTRO6=
OUTRO7=Trial Division is an easy approach to solve this task but there are more efficient ways for it.
OUTRO8=The algorithm is deterministic which means that it will always produce the same values for a given number.

VAR_ROLE_p=Array of prime factors found so far.
VAR_ROLE_f=Incremented value that is checked as a potential prime factor.
VAR_ROLE_n=Number to be factorized. Is decreased while the algorithm runs.
