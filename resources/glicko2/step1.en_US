If the player has not been rated yet,
we set their rating to 1500, the
rating deviation to 350 and the
volatility to 0.06.

Otherwise we use their pre-period ratings.


Implementation details:
It is important to create a working-copy
of the player ratings before you start
with the calculations, as we assume that
events in a single rating period happen
simultaneously and rating calculations
of one player's new rating should not affect
the calculations of the others.
