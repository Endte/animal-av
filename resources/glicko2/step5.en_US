In this step we calculate the new volatility sigma'.

The algorithm proposed for this by Prof. Glickman
is integrated in the pseudo code. But we will not
go into further detail as this part only finds
the zero of a function. It is based on the Illinois algorithm,
a variant of the regula falsi method, where the zero of
a function is approximated by approaching it from a negative
and positive point (here A and B, with C being the final result).
