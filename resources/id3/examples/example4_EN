Example: Rebecca's friends Shawn is a bookworm. Sometimes, she asks him which of the new books at the library are good to read.
He then recommends some to her. Now, Rebecca wants to predict which books Shawn will recommends to her and in order to do this, she 
gathers information about previous books shown to him and whether they were recommended. The data is stored in
a table (the 'main table'). One entry contains information about the author of the book (AUTHOR), its genre (GENRE) and the 
narrative perspective (PERSPECTIVE). And finally, the class value (on the right, 'yes' or 'no') describes whether Shawn recommended 
the book. ID3 takes these examples as an input to come up with a general concept about in which cases Shawn recommends books.

With the generated tree, Rebecca can predict whether new books are recommended by her friend.
And so can you:
Starting at the root node, follow the edges that correspond to the attribute values of the book; the 
leaf that you'll reach tells the expectation (but, of course, only based on the previously seen examples).
