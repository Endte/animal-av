Example: Jack is a mountaineer and he plans another ascent. His brother Jim helps him to organize it. He collected 
information about Jack's previous ascents and whether they were successful or not. There are stored in a table 
(the 'main table'). One entry contains information about the mountain height (HEIGHT), its slope (SLOPE) and if there
was snow on the mountain (SNOW). And finally, the class value (on the right) describes whether 
Jack made his way to the top or not. ID3 takes these examples as an input to come up with a general concept about 
which mountains are doable for Jack.

Jack seems to be a very successful mountaineer. The prediction is always 'yes'.
But this tree was created with only three examples seen (see below, first remark).
This tree consists only of one leaf (as the root).
