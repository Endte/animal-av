Example: A cook is working on a perfect cake recipe, but he is still not sure about which ingredients to pick. He made notes
about his previous creations' ingredients and whether or not these cakes were tasty or not. This data is organized in a table
(the 'main table'). One entry contains information about whether cream was an ingredient (CREAM), bananas were ingredients (BANANA)
and whether chocolate was an ingredient (CHOCOLATE). And finally, the class value (on the right, 'yes' or 'no') describes whether 
the resulting cake was tasty.
ID3 takes these examples as an input to come up with a general concept about which ingredient combination leads to tasty cakes.

With the generated tree the cook can check which ingredient combination leads to good results and which don't.
And so can you:
Starting at the root node, follow the edges that correspond to the attribute values of a recipe list/a cake; the 
leaf that you'll reach tells the expectation (but, of course, only based on the previously seen examples).
