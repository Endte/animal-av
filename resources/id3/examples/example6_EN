Example: Bill and Charlie often go to the candy store and try out new sugary delicacies. Based on some previous 
candies which Bill tried out or didn't try, Charlie wants find out which kind of candies Bill likes. Charlie stored 
information about these candies in a table (the 'main table'). One entry contains information about whether the candy 
is sweet or sour (TYPE), its shape (SHAPE) and its taste (TASTE). And finally, the class value (on the right, 'yes' or 
'no') describes whether Bill tried out the candy. ID3 takes these examples as an input to come up with a general 
concept about which candies Bill likes and which he doesn't like.

With the tree at hand, Charlie can predict which candies Bill will (probably) like and which he won't (probably) like.
Bill seems to like lollipops. A prediction for a new candy can be achieved by doing the following:
Starting at the root node, follow the edges that correspond to the attribute values of a candy; the 
leaf that you'll reach tells the expectation (but, of course, only based on the previously seen examples).
