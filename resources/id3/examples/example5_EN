Example: A software company hires new employees. Mr. Dilver thinks about working there, but before he applies for a job there,
he wants to predict whether he is hired or not. Some of his friends already applied for a job there and he knows whether they
were hired or not. He organizes this information in a table (the 'main table'). One entry contains information about a person's 
software skills (SKILLS), their experience so far (EXPERIENCE) and their high school grade (GRADE). And finally, the class value 
(on the right, 'yes' or 'no') describes whether this person was hired or not. 
ID3 takes these examples as an input to come up with a general concept about in which cases people are hired by the company.

With the generated tree, Mr. Dilver can predict if he will be hired. But of course, no matter what the tree predicts: If he
really wants to work there, he should definitely send his application to that company! This is how you can get a prediction:
Starting at the root node, follow the edges that correspond to the attribute values of a person; the 
leaf that you'll reach tells the expectation (but, of course, only based on the previously seen examples).
