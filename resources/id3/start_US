The ID3 Algorithm receives a list of data points (examples) and recursively constructs a decision tree, which
consists out of nodes (correspond to features of the data), leaves (correspond to the classes of the data) and
edges (which connect nodes and leaves). Examples consist of feature-value pairs and a class value whose distribution 
among the current examples should be explained by the resulting tree and is to be predicted for future 
examples as good as possible.


Of course, this is just a sample application - ID3 can generate trees for all kinds of data, provided that 
the corresponding examples can be described in terms of feature-value pairs.
