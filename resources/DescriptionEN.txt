The Riemann Integral is a numerical way to calculate integrals.[br]
We calculate two different families of rectangles in every step.[br]
The interval, of which we want to calculate the surface area is first divided into smaller [br]
intervals.
[/block]
[block]
For each of the smaller interval we first calculate the uppersum and then [br]
the lowersum. Then we add this two values and divide it by 2. [br]
The upper- and lowersum are defined for a dissection Z of [a,b] in n parts:[br]
The dissection is an finite sequence x_0, x_1, ..., x_n, with a = x_0 < x_1 < ... < x_n = b[br]
The upper- and lowersum is then defined as:[br]
O(Z) = sum(k = 1, n, (x_k - x_k-1) * sup(x_k-1, x_k) f(x)) [br]
U(Z) = sum(k = 1, n, (x_k - x_k-1) * inf(x_k-1, x_k) f(x)) [br]
[br]
The sum of the integral is: [br]
I(Z) = (O(Z) + U(Z)) / 2

Tip: Some rectangles could result in a negative surface area because their y coordinate is negativ.[br]
To avoid this you have to divide the dissection in more dissections, so that the negative and[br]
positives have their own dissection and then take the absolute values of the integrals.[br]
This doesn't only happen to numerical Integration but to all integrations.
