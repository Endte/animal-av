# Fill-in-the-blanks question. The question is displayed (everything
# to "endtext"). The user has to do of the marked answers to answer
# the question correctly.
# example of usage:
# 	fibquestion "pivotChoice"
# 	questionGroup "pivotPosition"
# 	nrRepeats 5
# 	points 3
# 	"Which pivot element will be chosen next?"
# 	"Please enter only the position, not the value!"
# 	endtext
# 	answer
# 	"5"
# 	"Position 5"
# 	"The last"
# 	endanswer

# Every "answer"-line signifies an answer

# Parses a multiple-choice question. Important: The order of the possible
# answers can be generated randomly, so that not always answer number 2 (for
# example) is the correct one. The intValue of answer is the position of
# the correct answer (beginning with 1!).
# example of usage:
# 	mcquestion "leftBorder"
# 	"Where is located the lower border of the next recursion level?"
# 	endtext
# 	"At 1"
# 	endchoice
# 	"At 2"
